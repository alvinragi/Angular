spec.ts file for unit testing

component.ts is the most important file with the classes

package.json keeps list of the packages

git ignore file keeps list of all the files thats not supposed to be pushed.

to run app - ng serve
to create a component - ng g c componentname

entry point - main.ts file
main will go to appconfig.ts

//angular will add new component into declaration as we create

then it will go into appcomponent.ts

//so it is ts will decide what will come in view, css etc

decorator will supply metadata, which helps angular to know the component of the class

selector gives the tag to be used in html file (index.html). the ts file will use this html file to display the componenets

can link multiple style urls

the creation of object is all under the hood. 
ts creates the object of the item that comes in view

Structural directives are the things that updates the DOM (ngIf)

to display a varibale, we use {{variable name}}
