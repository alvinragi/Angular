js dont have classes, only prototypes


primitive types will be pass by value.
reference types includes arrays, objects and funtions. Detection of changes are difficult because they change the address location.

object must be immutable, each time when change happens to object (when an api calls or smth) angular wont detect change because its still in the same memory location.
so we create a new object to detect these changes, also use map or filter





bitwise operators
ternary operators
type operators
type coercieon
